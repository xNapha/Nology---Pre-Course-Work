    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> in my opinion is one of the best websites for anything you can imagine.

It is an all inclusive platform, you will be able to find any type of niche there is an find a community tightnit community surrounding it. I dare say that it is most people's first source of any type of information out there.</p>
