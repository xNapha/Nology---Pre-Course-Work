Deep/Shallow Copying JSON
  JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
  -> "key value" pairs
  -> other languages can read JSON, but you have to parse it first
  Shallow vs Deep Copy
    Shallow
      - a new object is created
        - if any of the fields of the object are referenced to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied
    Deep Copy
      - copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields
      - a deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers
